1. Reason to write the assignment in Spring-boot framework is because of its dependencies management utility.
	-> As you might have noticed, I have used LOMBOK. a tool to generate extra code for my Entities ( in this case Teams )
	-> And suppose if I am asked to add or modify the code, i would prefer to use spring-boot just to make the work simple and effective

2. Instead of creating multiple .java files, I have used inner class because I wanted to make the interviewers job simple to find all code in one file.
	-> This coding convention is not encouraged as its a difficult to follow project architecture style.
	
3. I was asked to display my skills of OOP, so I took a global static object just to convey my hold with Object oriented programming.

4. Without the use of Data structure the solution for this question could not have been possible, while some prefer having traditional java arrays, I prefer Usage of Java Collections to minimize the length of code.
	-> And I also encourage people to use streams for iteration instead of loops.
	
5. In the question I am asked to write two code to perform two operation,
	i) to find the 2 consecutive losing teams 
	ii) to generalize the method for N losses or wins for M matches.
	I wrote one method whose arguments are result[boolean] stating win[true] or loss[false] and number of matches[integer]
	Which we can call multiple times to obtain both the results

6. The extra bit of a code that you see in the program present in the main method is all a part of decoration just to make the output more noticeable and stand out from the rest.
